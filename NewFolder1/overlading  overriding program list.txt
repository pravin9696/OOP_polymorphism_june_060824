November & December Batch Today's Practical Task...

Q.1 Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members-length and breadth and a function to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. 
The class has three constructors which are:

A: having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.

B: having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.

C: having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.

Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.

Q.2 WAP to Create a class name as Power with a parameterised constructor and one function int getPower( ).

Power(int , int)
{
// this constructor can accept the base and index.
}
int getPower()
{
//this function can return power of numbers.
}

Q.3 WAP to Create a class name as Majority with a parameterised constructor and one function int getMajority( ).

Majority(int [ ])
{
// this constructor can accept the array.
}

int getMajority()
{
//this function can use if it's yes then return 1 otherwise return 0.
}

Q.4 WAP to Create a class name as StudentPer with a parameterised constructor and two function void CalPer( ) and void checkGrades( ).

StudentPer(int [ ])
{
// this constructor can accept the array.
}

void CalPer( ) 
{
//this function can use calculate the percentage in array.
}

void checkGrades()
{
//this function can use check the grade.
		percentage >= 90% : Grade A
 		percentage >= 80% : Grade B
		percentage >= 70% : Grade C
		percentage >= 60% : Grade D
		percentage >= 50% : Grade E
		percentage >= 40% : Grade F
		percentage < 40% : Student is Fail.
}

Q.5 WAP to Create a class name as Employee with a parameterised constructor and two function void CalSal( ) and void showDetails( ).

Employee(int id,char name[ ],char contact[ ],int presentday,int perdaysal)
{
// this constructor can store the all data in instance variable of class.
}

void CalSal( ) 
{
//here need to write the logic for calculate the salary of employee as per his present days.
}

void showDetails()
{
//here show the all details of employee.
}

Q6. Write a cpp program to create class name as Area using parameterised constructor overloading name as :

	void Area(int)
	{
		//  calculate area of circle.
	}
	
	void Area(int , int)
	{
		//  calculate area of reactangle.
	}
	
	void Area(int , float)
	{
		//  calculate area of triangle.
	}	
	
Q7. Write a cpp program to create class name as Reverse using Constructor overloading name as :

	void Reverse(int [ ])
	{
		//  perform integer reverse array logic.
	}
	
	void Reverse(char [ ])
	{
		//  perform string reverse logic.
	}
	
Q8. Write a cpp program to create class name as Frequency using Constructor overloading name as :

	void Frequency(int [ ])
	{
		//  count even and odd number in array.
	}
	
	
	void Frequency(char [ ])
	{
		//  count alphabet , digit and special symbol charcterÂ inÂ string.
	}
